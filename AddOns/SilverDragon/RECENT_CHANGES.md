## Changed in v2025.5

* Undermine: added new loot for rares, consolidated the Steamboil / Handcrank parts
* RangeExtender:
    * Don't interfere with the tooltip for the native vignette when it *is* visible
    * Show a tag in the tooltip so the source is more obvious
    * Change the framelevels so they'll be a bit higher based on the Minimap frame
