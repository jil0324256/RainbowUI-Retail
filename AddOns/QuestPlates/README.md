# QuestPlates (Fork)

## Note
**Original Creator:** The original version of this addon was created by Semlar.  
**Permissions:** I do not have permissions to publish this onto CurseForge, and the original creator is currently AWOL. Despite reaching out, I have been unable to contact them. This is a fork of their work, with updates and improvements made where necessary.

---

## Overview
**QuestPlates** is an addon for World of Warcraft that enhances nameplates by displaying quest objectives directly on enemy health bars. This fork builds upon Semlar‚Äôs original addon with performance improvements and updated compatibility for the **The War Within** expansion.

---

## Features
- **Quest Objectives on Nameplates:** Displays the remaining mobs to kill or items to collect directly on the nameplate.
- **Customizable Settings:** Modify the position, size, and appearance of quest icons using simple commands.
- **Compatibility with Other Nameplate Addons:** Works seamlessly with TidyPlates, KuiNameplates, and Blizzard default nameplates.

---

## Usage

To customize icon position and size, use the following commands:

- Move the quest icon from the left to the right side of the nameplate:
  ```bash
  /run QuestPlateSettings.AnchorPoint = 'LEFT'; QuestPlateSettings.RelativeTo = 'RIGHT'; ReloadUI()
  ```

- Adjust the X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) offsets:
  ```bash
  /run QuestPlateSettings.OffsetX = -10; QuestPlateSettings.OffsetY = 5; ReloadUI()
  ```

- Reset settings to default:
  ```bash
  /run QuestPlateSettings = nil; ReloadUI()
  ```
